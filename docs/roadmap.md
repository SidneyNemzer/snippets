# Next version

* Refactor Code
  * See https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/how-to-scale-react-applications/
  * Flow?
* Allow the sidebar to be hidden/resized

# Soon

* Better linter defaults (seems to have an ES5 preset currently)
* Allow snippets to be run automatically when a URL is visited
* Add an extension badge popup which allows you to:
  * view your snippets
  * run snippets in the current page
  * open snippets in the editor
    * I'd like to do this but I don't think extensions can programmatically
      open the devtools
    * Maybe the editor becomes a stand-alone page, which can be opened via a
      URL, while the devtools tab just allows you to run them?

# Later

* More editor themes?
* Support other browsers (using WebExtensions API)
* Search Snippets
* Tag Snippets
