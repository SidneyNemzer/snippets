## How do I use this extension?

After installing the extension, open the Chrome Devtools on any webpage. This extension adds a new tab called "Snippets", where you can view, edit, and run your JavaScript code snippets.

## Chrome has built-in snippets. Why not sync those?

Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't allow extensions to access the built-in snippets, nor does it sync those on its own. So I created my own snippet editor!

## What did you use to make this extension?

The interface uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). The code editor is [react-ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace). [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [react-chrome-redux](https://github.com/tshaddix/react-chrome-redux) are used to sync all panels.

## Can you add *[insert feature here]*

## What font is the logo in?

Freestyle Script. Maybe you don't find that too interesting, but I'll forget it if I don't write it somewhere...
