# Next version

* Store Snippets as a Github Gist
  * Upload to GH after 30 sec of inactivity or browser is closed
  * Download in background page when it starts
    * (?) Download all Snippets at once

# Soon

* Allow the sidebar to be hidden/resized
* Better linter defaults (seems to have an ES5 preset currently)
* Allow snippets to be run automatically when a URL is visited
* Add an extension badge popup which allows you to:
  * view your snippets
  * run snippets in the current page
  * (?) open snippets in the editor
    * I'd like to do this but I don't think extensions can programmatically open the devtools

# Later

* (?) More editor themes
* Support other browsers (using WebExtensions API)
* Search Snippets
* Tag Snippets
