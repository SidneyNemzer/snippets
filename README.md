# WARNING

Currently, you can only store up to about 8000 bytes across all your snippets, due to the way Chrome's Sync storage works.

**If you exceed this amount, the new data will be lost!**

You'll see a warning if this happens. For now, you can avoid the issue by deleting snippets you aren't using. I plan to switch to a different storage method by April 30th. See issue [#5](https://github.com/SidneyNemzer/snippets/issues/5)
