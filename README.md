## Installing

This extension isn't ready yet!

It will be available on the Chrome Web Store once it's done

## FAQ

### Q: Why doesn't this use the snippets that are built-into chrome?

A: Chrome obviously doesn't sync those snippets itself. And unfortunately, Chrome doesn't allow extensions to access those snippets in any way. So I'm just re-implementing snippets myself.
