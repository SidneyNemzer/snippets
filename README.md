## FAQ

### Q: Why doesn't this just sync the snippets that are built-into chrome?

A: Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't allow extensions to access the built-in snippets. So I re-created a snippet editor.

### Q: What did you use to make this extension?

A: The interface uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The code editor is [react-ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace)

### Q: What font is the logo in?

A: Freestyle Script. Maybe you don't find that too interesting, but I need this here so I don't forget it...
